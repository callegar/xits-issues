The XITS-issues REPO
====================

Because development on [aliftype/xits](https://github.com/aliftype/xits) has
stopped and the repository has been archived, the issue tracker is no more.
For that reason, not only the fonts are frozen, but recording what can be
troublesome with them has become hard.

As of today, the sole role of this forked repo is to have an issue tracker where
to store potential problems with XITS.  No development is currently going on here
and the sole reason d'etre of the repo is to have an archive of potentially
troublesome usages of XITS so that one can:
- know if a problem he/she is experiencing is a known one;
- maybe find a workaround

The XITS font project
======================

XITS is a Times-like typeface for mathematical and scientific publishing, based
on [STIX fonts][1]. The main mission of XITS is to provide a version of STIX
fonts enhanced with the OpenType `MATH` table, making it suitable for high
quality mathematic typesetting with OpenType math-capable layout systems, like
Microsoft Office 2007+, XeTeX and LuaTeX.

XITS fonts are distributed under the [Open Font License][2], version 1.1.
